This directory is purely for the Controllers.

Controllers will handle the processing of the data using the models and return
them as a renderable output.

The function name must be used when defining the routes. There are no limits or
specifications, you can name them as you like.

A function must have the $response, $request, $args (if there are arguments for
your route) as parameters. You can probably rewrite this part via the BaseController
constructor or something like that,
