This directory contains all the models/classes/.. whatever you'd like to call them.
The way I use them won't probably be approved by the standard or whatever.

For what I use them:
 - Contains the properties/attributes.
 - Handles DB interaction based on the specified table.
 - Data interactions.

You can use them however you'd like. They can be fully customized, but the only
thing that is required (only if it extends the BaseModel) are the const-values.

The getters and setters are optional, but if there are no setters present, all
the fields will be listed under 'attributes'.

The usage of setters are highly recommended to, give it the proper var-type, do
some value manipulations, checks, ..
